<h3>Muhammad the messanger of God</h3>
<p>The Messenger of God is a 2015 film that follows the first 13 years of the life of the Prophet Muhammad. The film begins with Muhammad's birth after a great battle for Mecca, and then follows him as he travels with his uncle through the desert in the 6th century. The film also depicts the events of the city of Makkah in the 7th century AD, including the trials and tribulations of the Muslims who are on boycott, and the attempts of Abraha, the King of Habasha, to destroy the Kaaba.</p>
